              <blockquote>I followed a hare into this gym not knowing what magical land I would come upon, and my oh my it is an entirely new world! I swear I saw a caterpillar cozied in it's cocoon, a floating cat with a sassy grin and a tall scraggly man in a hat who was mad as the day is long! I couldn't believe how great it was in there, almost unbelievable! I had to ask myself if it was real or just a hallucination from the 10grams of 'shrooms I just ate to help cure my depression!</blockquote>

              <blockquote>So I went to Harvard law to get a boy back, but what I ended up getting was my personal power back! I had plenty of people who didn't think I could do it, but to that I said "I object"! Now I'm working for one of the top law firms in the world and when people ask how I did it I say "What, like it's hard?" After a long day of lawyering and stuff you can imagine I like to come to this gym! It's the perfect place to destress and get my body ready for a California girls night! We love it here, don't we Bruiser? "Ruff, ruff, rufffffff!!</blockquote>
