          <p>"So I went to Harvard law to get a boy back, but what I ended up getting was my personal power back! I had plenty of people who didn't think I could do it, but to that I said 'I object!' Now I'm working for one of the top law firms in the world and when people ask how I did it I say 'What, like it's hard?' After a long day of lawyering and stuff you can imagine I like to come to this gym! It's the perfect place to destress and get my body ready for a California girls night! We love it here, don't we Bruiser Woods? 'Ruff, ruff, rufffffff!!'"</p>
