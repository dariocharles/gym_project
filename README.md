## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of (my gym name) is to provide a clean, intuitive and child frieldy game to entertain and delight it's users?. (my gym name) has two target audience: Pre-school children and their parents.



(who is this for
what do they want to achieve
how my project is the best way to help them achieve these things)

#### Play goals

The central target audience for this game is pre-school children aged 1 to 5 years old.

Play goals are:
    * A fun game to play
    * Child-friendly controls
    * Large buttons and clickable areas for young fingers to operate
    * All game controls laid out together and in an intuitive way
    * Fun images and sounds
    * Visual and audio research while playing

(Gym name) is a great way to help players meet their needs because:

    * The planning and design process took all these needs into account before starting to build it.
    *  Controls are grouped together clearly
    *  Game controls are large, utilizing icons and colours to communicate this purpose before any words that a child would not be able to read
    *  (Gym name) includes audio and visual rewards as part of the game
    *  The overall feel and (Gym name) is fun and child friendly

#### Parental goals

Parents of pre-school children have a large amount to say about what games their children are exposed to, therefore parental needs must also be at the forefront of any project deisnged for children in this age group.

Paren'ts goals are:

   * A game with child development value, in this case to improve their memory and spiritual awareness
   * Usability to the range of abilities in pre-school kids
   * A visually appealing well-functioning game
   * The ability for a parent to reset the stored player profile
   * A mute button

(Gym name) is a great wya to help parents meet these needs because:

    * (gym name) gives a child a fun environment which to practice their memory skills
    * Game includes 3 levels of difficulty ranging from 8 to 16 cards
    * It has been designed with user experience as a priority, not only for a child using it but also for a parent
    * The game includes a reset data option, which is easy to find and operate by an adult who can read and do simple mathemathic

### Developer and Business Goals
 
   * Well thought out programming that prepares for a child's random and unpredictable use of (gym name). For example, that the game cannot bebroken by clicking many areas quickly, or if it is restarted at an unexpected moment
   * A professional looking first dip into the world of using JavaScript, jQuery and Jasmine
   * A project the devleoper is excited to make a part of her portfolio

### User Stories

â€¢	As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

As a player aged between 1-5 years old, I want:

    1. The ability to really find and understand the controls for the game, so that I can operate them easily.
    2. Large, easy to press buttons and controls, so that my young fingers can use on all devices
    3. Audio and/or visual feedbakc when I play hye game, so that I know when I have clicked or not clicked something.
    4. The ability to choose from cards with my favourite children's characters on, so that i am even more engaged in finding them in the game
    5. Positve audio feedback when I coplete a step in the game (for example when I find a matching pair of cards), because this increased my enjoyment from playing.
    6. Visual icons and images that I recognize, so that I understand when I have achieved something in the game. For example stars out of five, and a trophy for high schore.
    7. The ability to see my old scores when I return to the game, so I can try to beat them.

As a parent of a palyer, I want:

        1. Levels of difficulty for my child to choose from, so that they are engaged for longer and the game is useable for a wide age range. 
        2. Visually and operationally appealing game, so that I also have a positive experience when using it with my child
        3. The ability to delete a stored profile, so I can reset the game for another go, or another child
        4. The option to delete a profile ot be easy for me to find, but not easy for a child hwo is randomly pressing buttons to accesss, so that a profile is not deleted by accident
        5. A mute button to be included, so that the sounds cna be switched off when they become annoying (if only the actual child came with one of these too!)
        6. To know who made the game and how i can contac tthem

## Design Choices

The overall feel of hte game is one that is designed for children to enjoy. The follwing design choices were made with this mind set:

### Fonts

    * The primary font (B0ld)Fredoka One(bold) was chosen becuase it resembles the simple letters used in products made for ore-school children, it's likeness to fridge magnets for children is nostalgic for parents as well
    * The secondary font (bold)Bubblegum Sans(bold) was chosen for its childlike qualities, while complementing the primary font nicely in style because it's more compact

### Icons

    * All icons used were chosed for their obvious meaning and prupose so that they can be understood by everyone

### Colours

    * The primary colour choices of dark and light blue for the logo, titles and text were chosen because they have a clean clear aspect while contrasing each other well
    * Other colours used in the porject were taken from the trophy image sourced, using a colour picker in Photoshop to make sure all colours used were consistent across the entire project

### Styling

    * Cards and container boxes were given rounded corners to continue the child friendly theme, many real life memory cards for children have corners like this
    * Repeating the same rounded corner pattern throught the page keeps consistency in design and maintinas the feeling that all elements belong together/

### Backgrounds

    * The bakcground image of toy trains was chosed to give the feeling of playing the game in a child's playroom
    * Specifically chosen because it is a "flat-lay" - a photograph taken from directly above - this means the background compliments the game wihtout distracting from it.
    * The background images for the modals were chosen for their cominc-book like qualities, adding a little positive emotional feedback at a level that appeals to a child

### Card iamges

    * Disney and Pixar characters were chosen for this game because they are recognizsed and loved by children. Cars characters were specifically chosed because it is extremely popular with boys, the frozenc haracters because they are popular with girls, and the toy stary character ebcause they appeal to both boys and girls. 

### Audio files

    * To continue the feeling of a game made for children, clicking button sounds were added that are similar to the sounds a child might hear when operating a physical toy with buttons
    * The card flipping sounds and "bing" on a correct match were added to give positive feedback on use of the game.
    * The sound of appluading children played on completeing the game was chosen becuase it appeals most to children, and again fits within the teme of (gym name)


## (bold)Wireframe:(bold)   (links to wireframesm either include as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser - should be mobile, table, and browser wireframes )

### Code - 
eg. 
    * Code for floating buttons taken from this W3Schools(hyperlink) post.
    * Code for function to capitalize first letter of username was taken from this (hyperlink) post.


### Awknowledgents

    *Documents where I found the code with link and with the code pasted

    * I used bootstraps 4.6 (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/navbar/) navbar template for my own navbar.

<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNavDropdown" aria-controls="navbarNavDropdown" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNavDropdown">
        <ul class="navbar-nav">
        <li class="nav-item active">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item dropdown">
            <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="navbarDropdownMenuLink" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
            Dropdown link
            </a>
            <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdownMenuLink">
            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>
            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>
            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>
            </div>
        </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</nav>  
    
    * I used bootstrap 4.6 carousel code. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/carousel/

<div id="carouselExampleIndicators" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators" data-slide-to="2"></li>
  </ol>
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    </div>
  </div>
  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleIndicators" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleIndicators" role="button" data-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
</div>

* I used bootstraps alert code

### Deployment

This site was deployed to github pages.


### Steps for other developers to access and run code
* Document steps needed to clone install and run code so other developmer could contribute if I wanted to give them access. 

### Testing Section  = Separate testing.md file

* I tested the hyperlinks and they all work, 
* I have used dev tools test responsiveness for multiple screen ssizes. 
* I uses W3C Markup Validation to test my HTML
* I have used the CSS Validator to test my CSS - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
* Include steps to running my project in a coding envirnment like gitpod.
* Testing if my site meets the needs and wants documented in UX???
* Lighthouse description - Use light house in dev tools to check site for performance, best practices and accessibility.

## Bugs discovered:

Solved bugs

eg. 
1. Custom modal opacity issues
    * The entire contents of my custom search modal was becoming transparent when I tried to use the opacity css property on it's container
    * To solve this I switched to using rgbs values instea, which have built in transparency but do not effect any further elements contained within
             AND SHOW THE CODE


    * I had trouble getting the alert anchor tag to align vertically in the center
    * I solved this by...
    And show code

    * I had trouble getting the Member Benefits heading closer to the list items.
    * How I solved this - I realized the margins were  tall on the list items and fixed them. 
    and show code

    * In the footer, I realized that the icons were not centered despite using text-center. 
    * I solved this going into dev tools and seeing that the div container had a padding on the right side that pushed every slightly to the left. I added a padding-left of 0 and this resolved the issue.
    SHOW CODE

    * For some reason the I had a x overflow. I discovered it was because of the hero image section. The alert is overflowing, the welcome banner on the home page is overflowing and the address and modal section on the contact page are overflowing. I fixed the welcome banner by putting the class="row" in a container. 

* The webpages have a x overflow control, I am not sure. That is something I would continue working on. I used overflow-x: hidden; to prevent this from happening. The alert the contact address and the home welcome banner. They were all fixed by adding a container class was fixed by adding a container class. 

* I was fighting with a bug for a while where the carousel's weren't moving. I discovered it was because I was duplicating slides as I worked on them to paste next to each other and I hadn't taken off the active from the original one I posted on the other two. This prevented the slide from sliding and was stuck on the first slide. 


 ## What I would continue to work on if had time 
 * I styled many of my elements inline. However, I realized as I was working that there are times when it's more benefitial to style the elements on the HTML page, when it a single element not found anywhere else in the website, then in the CSS file and there are other times when it's is more benefitial to style the elements on the CSS page. If I wanted to continue to make this site better, I would make a clear distinction between these. I realized that styling in the CSS file is better when those elements are repeated throughout the website such as the footer or else duplicated such as the styling for the two membership options. That way I can target differents with the same stylings easier and when deciding to change a styling I only have to change it in one spot. I will continue to work on being consistent with this in future projects. 

* The footer icons where giving me trouble. I began working with mx-5, but this created a format in the mobile size that didn't work well. I wanted to give the mobile version mx-4, but after a while of working on this I didn't manage to figure out how to set a different margin for different screen sizes. I decided to move on make it super simple by giving the icons a mx-4 for all screen sizes.  

* The size of the images - how they are supposed to work - the about and contact work alright in each screen size, by is it possible for them to have the same image view in all sizes?   The image for the hero image I'm not sure how to fix.
