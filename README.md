## Goals

### Business Goals
The business's goals for this website are to build their brand, engage with their target audience and bring traffic to their social media accounts. I have done this by making the website informative and easily navigated in order to ensure a quality user experience as well as with the style choices that. T

### User Goals
The user's goals when coming to this website are to quickly find information they are looking for.


### Developer Goals
My intention for building this website is to practice my design skills and technical skills to build a four page coherent website. My goals were to make the website responsive and to implement HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap together while meeting the needs of the fictional business and potential clients. 

## User Experience UX
When to user comes to the website they will experience a easily navigated website with as few clicks as necessary that answers their questions and provide further contact information and social media outlets to engage with the company. The website has a strong brand with an exclusive, high-end feel that sparks an emotional connection with it's audience.

### Some user stories include:

        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate 
          their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

### Design

- Colour Scheme
    - The two main colours used are black and white which were chosen to give the website a professional, minimalist feel. 
- Typography
    - The Manrope font is used for the headers and the Roboto font is used for other with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Manrope and Roboto are clean fonts that can be easily read, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
- Imagery
    - The images used in this site are consistent with one another as well as the brand identity. The background hero image is designed to catch the user’s attention and immediately tell the user what the business is about. It also has a modern, uplifting feel appropriate for a fitness business. 
- Style
    - I choice rounded corners to give the website a warm feel.

### Wireframe
    I didn't have a clear image of starting this site beforehand because of my inexperience in design ideas. So I decided to opt out of wireframes and focus on exploring what was possible. For future website I will use wireframes as a tool for design when it is clear in my head of what I am designing, rather then the focus of this site which was how to use the technologies.

## Known Bugs

# Questions for markers****
- Membership Benefits - The three columns are staying in the middle and I had to make a two column break point because they squeeze in so tightly. What I wanted was have one breakpoint from three columns to one columns. I'm not sure how to make the three columns use the space in the div on the sides. I feel this issue repeated itself a few times in this website and is something I will have to find someone to ask. So if you the marker read this, I hope to comment on what I am not doing correctly here. 
- I'm not sure if I used the images correctly for the about and contact pages. How can I make an image stay the same view for all responsive design. What is happening now is that the images are zoomed out when are the largest screen size and zoom in as get smaller. If it is meant to do this action for images in a banner, how do I position them so they are always looking good at all widths. 
-The hero image has the same issue as above. But didn't manage to make it look good in other screen sizes then laptop view. 
- I was having trouble positioning the text on the hero image. I wanted to have the text centered at smaller screen sizes and to on the left of the image on larger screen sizes as it is now. What is a simple way I could position the text responsively?
