### User Stories

â€¢	As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

As a player aged between 1-5 years old, I want:

    1. The ability to really find and understand the controls for the game, so that I can operate them easily.
    2. Large, easy to press buttons and controls, so that my young fingers can use on all devices
    3. Audio and/or visual feedbakc when I play hye game, so that I know when I have clicked or not clicked something.
    4. The ability to choose from cards with my favourite children's characters on, so that i am even more engaged in finding them in the game
    5. Positve audio feedback when I coplete a step in the game (for example when I find a matching pair of cards), because this increased my enjoyment from playing.
    6. Visual icons and images that I recognize, so that I understand when I have achieved something in the game. For example stars out of five, and a trophy for high schore.
    7. The ability to see my old scores when I return to the game, so I can try to beat them.

As a parent of a palyer, I want:

        1. Levels of difficulty for my child to choose from, so that they are engaged for longer and the game is useable for a wide age range. 
        2. Visually and operationally appealing game, so that I also have a positive experience when using it with my child
        3. The ability to delete a stored profile, so I can reset the game for another go, or another child
        4. The option to delete a profile ot be easy for me to find, but not easy for a child hwo is randomly pressing buttons to accesss, so that a profile is not deleted by accident
        5. A mute button to be included, so that the sounds cna be switched off when they become annoying (if only the actual child came with one of these too!)
        6. To know who made the game and how i can contac tthem

## Design Choices

The overall feel of hte game is one that is designed for children to enjoy. The follwing design choices were made with this mind set:

### Fonts

    * The primary font (B0ld)Fredoka One(bold) was chosen becuase it resembles the simple letters used in products made for ore-school children, it's likeness to fridge magnets for children is nostalgic for parents as well
    * The secondary font (bold)Bubblegum Sans(bold) was chosen for its childlike qualities, while complementing the primary font nicely in style because it's more compact

### Icons

    * All icons used were chosed for their obvious meaning and prupose so that they can be understood by everyone

### Colours

    * The primary colour choices of dark and light blue for the logo, titles and text were chosen because they have a clean clear aspect while contrasing each other well
    * Other colours used in the porject were taken from the trophy image sourced, using a colour picker in Photoshop to make sure all colours used were consistent across the entire project

### Styling

    * Cards and container boxes were given rounded corners to continue the child friendly theme, many real life memory cards for children have corners like this
    * Repeating the same rounded corner pattern throught the page keeps consistency in design and maintinas the feeling that all elements belong together/

### Backgrounds

    * The bakcground image of toy trains was chosed to give the feeling of playing the game in a child's playroom
    * Specifically chosen because it is a "flat-lay" - a photograph taken from directly above - this means the background compliments the game wihtout distracting from it.
    * The background images for the modals were chosen for their cominc-book like qualities, adding a little positive emotional feedback at a level that appeals to a child

### Card iamges

    * Disney and Pixar characters were chosen for this game because they are recognizsed and loved by children. Cars characters were specifically chosed because it is extremely popular with boys, the frozenc haracters because they are popular with girls, and the toy stary character ebcause they appeal to both boys and girls. 

### Audio files

    * To continue the feeling of a game made for children, clicking button sounds were added that are similar to the sounds a child might hear when operating a physical toy with buttons
    * The card flipping sounds and "bing" on a correct match were added to give positive feedback on use of the game.
    * The sound of appluading children played on completeing the game was chosen becuase it appeals most to children, and again fits within the teme of (gym name)
